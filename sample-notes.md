# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Key Definitions

**Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Unsupervised Learning**: Machine learning technique that finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.

**Neural Network**: A computational model inspired by biological neural networks, consisting of interconnected nodes that process information.

## Important Concepts

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple hidden layers that can learn complex patterns in large datasets.

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant details, leading to poor performance on new data.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Classification problems
   - Regression problems
   - Uses labeled training data

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality reduction
   - Pattern discovery

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Agent-based learning
   - Reward/punishment system
   - Decision making optimization

## Common Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values using linear relationships
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-like model for decision making
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
- **Support Vector Machines**: Finds optimal boundary between classes
- **K-Means**: Clustering algorithm that groups data into k clusters

## Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions made.

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to total positive predictions.

Recall measures the ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positive cases.

F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single score for model performance.
